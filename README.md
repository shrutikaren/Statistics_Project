# Statistics_Project
Mini-experimental design projects and my approach towards those experiments by using R Studio. These experiments may involves Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD), Latin Square Design, Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD) and Factorial Designs.

For each project, a specific mini-experimental design is created with a corresponding documentation. In each folder, you will find the documentation as well as the R Studio code that goes alongside the project. If you are interested in try along, download the csv files and read them into your R Studio. Go through the documentation to make sure that you have understood the purpose of the experiment, why the design model was chosen and how you could calculate results to get some very interesting findings.
